# 📊 Risk Register: Community Bank Operations

This project presents a **risk register** for a fictional community bank operating in a coastal U.S. region. It identifies and prioritizes cybersecurity and operational risks using a qualitative **likelihood × severity** matrix.

The analysis is guided by risk management principles relevant to **NIST**, **GLBA**, and **FFIEC** expectations for financial institutions.

---

## 🏦 Operational Environment

- 100 on-premise employees and 20 remote employees  
- 2,000 individual and 200 commercial accounts  
- Partnership with a professional sports team and 10 local businesses  
- Located in a coastal area with low crime rates  
- Must comply with **Federal Reserve cash availability** and **financial data protection regulations**

## 🧾 Sample Risks & Prioritization

| Asset                  | Risk                        | Likelihood | Severity | Priority |
|------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|----------|----------|
| Funds                  | Business email compromise   | 2          | 2        | 4        |
| User database          | Poor encryption             | 3          | 3        | 9        |
| Financial records      | Public backup exposure      | 3          | 3        | 9        |
| Physical cash          | Bank safe left unlocked     | 1          | 3        | 3        |
| Supply chain deliveries| Natural disaster disruption | 1          | 2        | 2        |

## 📌 Key Observations

- **Highest risks** involve data exposure: poorly encrypted user databases and unsecured backups  
- **Human error** is a recurring factor: phishing emails, weak access control  
- **Environmental risks** (e.g., supply chain disruptions from weather) are low likelihood but noted  
- **Theft** risk is lower due to low crime, but policy gaps still need addressing  

---

## 🛠 Recommendations

- Conduct **employee training** to combat phishing and social engineering  
- Improve **encryption standards** on all customer data  
- Audit and secure **backup infrastructure**  
- Review physical security protocols and ensure safes are locked by default  
- Prepare contingency plans for **supply chain delays** due to severe weather
